"""Tax Bracket Calculator

Here is the break-down on how much a US citizen's income was
taxed in 2019

      $0 - $9,700   10%
  $9,701 - $39,475  12%
 $39,476 - $84,200  22%
 $84,201 - $160,725 24%
$160,726 - $204,100 32%
$204,101 - $510,300 35%
$510,301 +          37%

For example someone earning $40,000 would
pay $4,658.50, not $40,000 x 22% = $8,800!

    9,700.00 x 0.10 =       970.00
   29,775.00 x 0.12 =     3,573.00
      525.00 x 0.22 =       115.50
----------------------------------
              Total =     4,658.50
